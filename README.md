SharpOS is a lightweight DOS-like operating system built using C# and COSMOS.

## Goals

SharpOS may be DOS-like right now - with less than ten commands - but here are some of the goals.

 - *Full ShiftOS cross-compatibility* - I want to make it so running a .saa in ShiftOS and running a .saa in SharpOS will do the exact same thing - and I want ShiftOS lua scripts to be compatible with SharpOS. Another goal is to have ShiftOS skins compatible with SharpOS, and have a desktop environment that will support ShiftOS applications.
 - *Appscape Integration* - Another goal is to have full integration with the Appscape Package Manager - create an app for ShiftOS, and it'll work on SharpOS.
 - *And so much more*. With this much power, my brain is full of ideas.
